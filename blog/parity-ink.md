# First impressions of Rust smart contract programming with Parity's Ink

I am on a slow journey to learn about smart contract programming in Rust.
Today I am going to finally dip into [`ink`], a framework for writing
smart contracts for blockchains built on Parity's [Substrate] framework,
which includes the recently-launched [Polkadot] network.

[`ink`]: https://github.com/paritytech/ink
[Substrate]: https://www.parity.io/substrate/
[Polkadot]: https://www.parity.io/polkadot/

I have previously written impressions of other blockchains,
and their smart contract programming experiences:
[NEAR], [Nervos], [Ethereum].

# About Ink, Parity, Polkadot, and Substrate

`ink` is described in their readme as an "eDSL",
or "embedded domain-specific language".
