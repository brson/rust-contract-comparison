# A comparison of Rust smart contract platforms


## Platforms

These are the blockchains I'm most interested in running Rust on at the moment.

- NEAR - WASM, sharded
- Polkadot / Substrate - WASM, sharded
- Nervos - RISC-V
- Solana - eBPF, high throughput
- Secret Network - WASM, SGX
- Ethereum 2 - WASM, sharded
- Ethereum 1 - EVM, no Rust backend yet
